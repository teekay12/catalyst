This repo contains solutions to task 2 and 3

#Task2
This is a simple file the prints the first shortest string in each line of a file onto the screen. To run this the intended file needs to be in same folder as the script and run the command below

'php fileparser.php <filename.txt>'

The potential issue is probably trying with a large set of data and this could result in a performance/memory issue.

#Task 3
This an OOP design to illustrate a filesystem. This is basic as it illusterates the simple actions that occurs in a file system. This can be run by simply executing the command below.

'php filesystem.php'
